# Frontend (Expo)

This folder houses the Expo app. Run the commands below from `frontend/`.

## Get started

1) Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

2) Start the app
```bash
npm start         # or: npm run android | ios | web
```

Editing happens in the `app/` directory, which uses Expo Router's file-based routing.

## Reset to a blank app

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This moves the current starter code into `app-example/` and generates a fresh `app/` scaffold.
