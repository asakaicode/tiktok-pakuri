# TikTok Pakuri

This repo is now split into `frontend` and `backend` so we can run the Expo client and an API server side by side (e.g., via a future `docker-compose.yaml` at the root).

- `frontend/` – existing Expo project (React Native + Expo Router)
- `backend/` – placeholder for the upcoming API server

## Frontend (Expo)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start       # or: npm run android | ios | web
```

Project docs for the app live in `frontend/README.md`.

## Backend

`backend/` is empty for now; add your server code here when ready.
